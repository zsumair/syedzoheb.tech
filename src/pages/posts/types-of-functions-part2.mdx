## Types of Functions - Part2

This article is continuation of previous article on the Types of Functions [PART1](https://www.syedzoheb.tech/posts/types-of-functions-part1)

### Currying Functions

Curry functions does the same as other functions , only they don't call a functions rather transforms it. Currying a function is like forcing a function to take single parameter at a time rather than all at once like instead of `func(x,y,z)` we curry it to `func(x)(y)(z)`.

Example:

```
const fullName = function(firstName) {
	return function(lastName) {
		return firstName + ' ' + lastName
	}
}

console.log(fullName('curry')('function'));

```

### Callback Functions

A callback is a function which you pass as an argument to another function for executing later.

Example:

```
function greeting(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}

function callbackFunc(callback) {
  const name = 'Callback'
  callback(name);
}

callbackFunc(greeting);
```

### Higher Order Functions

A regular function that takes one or more functions as arguments and returns a function as a value from it is called a higher order function.

Example:

```
function calculate(operation, initialValue, numbers) {
	let total = initialValue;

	for (const number of numbers) {
		total = operation(total, number);
	}
	return total;
}

function sum(a, b) {
	return a + b;
}

calculate(sum, 0, [1, 2, 4]);

```

A difference between callback and Higher order functions is that in callback a function is just passed to another function. Meanwhile, in higher order functions, a function takes another function as argument and returns a function as value.
